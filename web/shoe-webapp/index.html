          A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the
          human foot. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and
          climate conditions, it is vulnerable, and shoes provide protection.
          Form was originally tied to function, but over time, shoes also became
          fashion items.

          </button>
        </div>
        <p class="hide">
          Additionally, shoes have often evolved into many different designs,
          such as high heels, which are most commonly worn by women during fancy
          occasions. Contemporary footwear varies vastly in style, complexity
          and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple
          strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous
          designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction
          and sell for large sums of money. Some shoes are designed for specific
          purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or
          skiing, while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers
          which have transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a
          general use shoe.
